# VeganPlus

We are building a mobile application to help people get started on their vegan journey, to inspire the experienced vegan finding healthy and tasty recipes with nutritional facts.

We have 3 members in our team: Francis Tatepo, Joshua Meyers and Liana van Zyl who are working together on this project.

The main features are:

Home page: With a search bar to search recipes and filter your preferences from here
Recipe page: Where you can scroll though more vegan recipes
Favorite page: Where you can ultimately save your favorite recipes

To build our application we made use of Javascript, CSS, Styled-components and React. We are building a SPA with the use of React Route to navigate through the application pages.
